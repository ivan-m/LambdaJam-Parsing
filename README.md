pandoc-slideshow
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivan-m/pandoc-slideshow.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ivan-m/pandoc-slideshow)

This is a base repository for how I make presentations using [Pandoc]
and reveal.js hosted on [GitHub Pages].  For example, the sample
slides found in [`Slides.md`] can be found [here].

This assumes that you use pandoc-mode for Emacs to help you write your
slides.  If you don't, you will need to edit [`runPandoc.hs`]
appropriately.

Note: whilst I'm currently using `reveal.js` for this, there's no
reason you can't use this for any other HTML-based slideshow format
that can be generated by Pandoc; you'll just need to change where the
symbolic link `.Slides.md.default.pandoc` points to.

Directions for use
------------------

1. Clone/copy this repository.

2. Edit the `.travis.yml` file:

    a) Specify the `GH_REPO` to point to your actual repository.

    b) Add a `GH_TOKEN` by [generating] one and then [encrypting] it.

       i.   Create a new token with `public_repo` permissions.
       ii.  `travis encrypt GH_TOKEN=...`
       iii. Replace current `secure: ...` with produced output.

    c) Change the version of GHC and cabal-install if necessary.

    d) Any other changes you want to make.

3. Any images, CSS changes or updates to the reveal.js subtree need to
   be made in the `shared-data` branch and then merged into `master`..

4. Make sure you have enabled your branch on your [Travis-CI profile].

    - You will probably want to set it so that only branches with a
      `.travis.yml` file will be built, to avoid failing builds when
      you updated the `shared-data` branch.
